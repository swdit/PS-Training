# welcome to your first task :)

Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).

But:
for multiples of three,   print "Fizz" instead of the number;
for multiples of five,   print "Buzz" instead of the number;
for multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

But 2:
give me three different solutions
